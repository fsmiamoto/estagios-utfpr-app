## Motivation

The main purpose of this project was for me to practice some frontend development while trying out new
stuff.

This project is a work in progress, as some implementations were not done in the best way and can definitely see 
some improvement over time, which are going to be tracked with issues in the repo.

If you find any problems or have a suggestion, you can open an issue to discuss it :)

## Built with:

- React (Hooks)
- Typescript
- Styled components
- Apollo GraphQL
